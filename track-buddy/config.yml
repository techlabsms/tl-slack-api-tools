      +++ *:wave::skin-tone-3: Welcome to your TrackStudy-Buddy Group :wave::skin-tone-3:* +++


      Great to see all of you here! Let me briefly introduce you to each other: :woman-with-bunny-ears-partying: You are each other's Study Buddies! :woman-with-bunny-ears-partying:


      *:hearts: Here's what you already have in common:*

      - You're all taking the same track :tlfav:

      - You will probably run into the same challenges and experience similar Aha-moments you want to share with your TrackStudy-Buddies :bulb:

      - You are all super excited to be part of our global TechLabs community and get to know each other :earth_americas:


      *:tada: We highly encourage you to meet remotely and on a regular basis. Here are some ideas:*

      - Find a time and date to play https://skribbl.io togehter :female-artist::skin-tone-4:

      - Let your group know whenever you're working on your track, to motivate each other and exchange ideas or clarify questions while your learning :couple:

      - Set up "Getting stuff done" calls - Block 2 hours in your calendar, make a quick group call at the beginning, state goals for the next 2 hours, achieve them and make a group call again at the end of the time slot to share your progress :mega:

      - Post any sort of questions, ideas, aha-moments or fun facts into the channel and connect :earth_americas:

      - Meet up for virtual coffee dates :coffee:Ô∏è

      - Use Polly (slack add-in tool) or a doodle to find a date and time that works for everyone :alarm_clock:


      *:fast_forward: TO BEGIN WITH: Start a quick introduction round!*

      - Where are you from?

      - What are you currently working on (job, studies, projects, ideas...)

      - What is you biggest learning from the last week (not necessarily bootcamp related :upside_down_face:)

      - 1 fun fact about you


      Enjoy and please shoot a message to *Valentine Poth* or *Julia Kirsch* if you have any further questions or issues regarding the buddy program :confetti_ball:
